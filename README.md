## 6. System Architecture

*   **[Describe the system architecture here. Include a brief explanation of the key components and their interactions. You can use bullet points or a short paragraph.]**
    *   **Frontend (React):** Handles user interface, user interactions, and data display.
    *   **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all frontend requests, handles authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
    *   **Backend (Express.js):** 
        *   **Product Service:** Handles product-related operations (e.g., fetching products, searching, filtering).
        *   **UserService:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
        *   **OrderService:** Handles order creation, processing, and fulfillment. 
    *   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores product information, user data, orders, and other relevant data.
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** Handles user authentication and authorization.
    *   **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances of the backend services to improve performance and scalability.
